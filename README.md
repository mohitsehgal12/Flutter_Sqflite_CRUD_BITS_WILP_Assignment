# Flutter_Sqflite_CRUD_BITS_WILP_Assignment

Writing an app that needs to persist and query large amounts of data on a local device, consider using a database instead of a local file or key-value store. In general, databases provide faster inserts, updates, and queries compared to other local persistence solutions.

Flutter apps can use SQLite databases via the sqflite plugin, which is available on pub.dev. You can create an application that uses sqflite to perform basic operations like inserting, reading, updating, and removing data about various persons.
